LVM manages disk drives. It allows multiple drives and partitions to be combined into larger volume groups, assists in making backups through a snapshot, and allows for dynamic volume resizing. It can also provide mirroring similar to a RAID 1 array.

physical volumes
These are physical disks or partitions such as /dev/sda3 or /dev/sdb.
volume groups
These are named groups of physical volumes that can be manipulated by the administrator. The number of physical volumes that make up a volume group is arbitrary. Physical volumes can be dynamically added or removed from a volume group.
logical volumes
Volume groups may be subdivided into logical volumes. Each logical volume can then be individually formatted as if it were a regular Linux partition. Logical volumes may be dynamically resized by the administrator according to need.

Creating a Logical Volume
Logical volumes are the partitions that your operating system uses in LVM. To create a logical volume we first need to have a physical volume and volume group.

Create LVM partition using - 
fdisk /dev/sdb

pvcreate /dev/sdb1

vgcreate vgpool /dev/sdb1

lvcreate -L 3G -n lvstuff vgpool

mkfs -t ext3 /dev/vgpool/lvstuff


EXTENT SHRINK VOLUMES

Instead, you can add a new hard drive and extend your volume group on the fly. Or if you have a hard drive that isn’t used you can remove it from the volume group to shrink your logical volume.

There are three basic tools for making physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes bigger or smaller.

Note: Each of these commands will need to be preceded by pv, vg, or lv depending on what you are working with.

resize – can shrink or expand physical volumes and logical volumes but not volume groups
extend – can make volume groups and logical volumes bigger but not smaller
reduce – can make volume groups and logical volumes smaller but not bigger

vgextend vgpool /dev/sdc1

lvextend -L8G /dev/vgpool/lvstuff   , makes it of 8GB

lvextend -L+3G /dev/vgpool/lvstuff  , Adds 3GB to existing LV

And lastly we will need to extend the actual file system.

resize2fs /dev/vgpool/lvstuff

Shrink Logical Volume

If you wanted to remove a hard drive from a volume group you would need to follow the above steps in reverse order and use lvreduce and vgreduce instead.

resize file system (make sure to move files to a safe area of the hard drive before resizing)
reduce logical volume (instead of + to extend you can also use – to reduce by size)
remove hard drive from volume group with vgreduce

Create New Snapshot

To create a snapshot of lvstuff use the lvcreate command like before but use the -s flag.

lvcreate -L512M -s -n lvstuffbackup /dev/vgpool/lvstuff
